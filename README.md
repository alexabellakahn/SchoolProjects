The Main class demonstrates base conversions, substring generation, and the Euclidean algorithm for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD). It includes methods to convert a decimal number to binary (dectobi), convert binary to hexadecimal (bitohex), generate all possible substrings of a string (getAllSubstrings), and compute the GCD of two numbers using recursion (gcd). Through recursive calls and base case handling, each method exhibits fundamental concepts in recursive problem-solving and string manipulation.

The BlackjackPlayer and BlackjackCard classes simulate a player in a Blackjack game, with each BlackjackPlayer object managing a hand of BlackjackCard objects. The BlackjackCard class extends a generic Card class to add value-handling specific to Blackjack, such as treating face cards as 10 and allowing Aces to be either 1 or 10. The BlackjackPlayer class provides methods to calculate the total hand value (getTotalHand), display cards (seeHand), and add new cards (hit). The design allows players to adjust Ace values dynamically, enhancing the realism of a Blackjack simulation.

The Defendant and Risk_Assessment classes model a simple risk assessment system for parole eligibility. Each Defendant object has a trueRisk probability of reoffending, which is randomly assigned and categorized into risk levels (low, medium, high) based on user-defined thresholds. The Risk_Assessment class generates and categorizes defendants based on these risk levels, granting parole to low-risk defendants, denying parole to high-risk ones, and giving medium-risk defendants a 50% chance. After simulating parole decisions, the program outputs statistics on reoffending rates, illustrating the impact of risk assessment on parole outcomes.

The HerdImmunity class simulates disease spread across a grid, where each cell represents an individual who may be vaccinated, infected, or susceptible. Users specify the vaccination rate, grid size, and simulation duration. The program calculates the probability of infection based on vaccination status and the number of infected neighbors, iterating through each day and updating infection statuses. After the simulation, the program outputs the percentage of the population infected, demonstrating the potential impact of herd immunity on disease control.

Finally, the FloodFill class demonstrates a flood fill algorithm for image processing. It reads a grid from a file, representing an image where each cell has a color. Starting from a specified cell, the flood fill algorithm recursively changes the color of all connected cells with the same initial color to a new specified color. This technique, similar to the “paint bucket” tool in image editing, showcases depth-first traversal in grid structures.
